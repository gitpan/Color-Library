METHODS
    $dictionary = Color::Library->dictionary( <dictionary_id> )
        Returns a Color::Library::Dictionary object corresponding to
        <dictionary_id>

    @dictionaries = Color::Library->dictionaries
    @dictionaries = Color::Library->dictionaries( <dictionary_id>,
    <dictionary_id>, ... )
    $dictionaries = Color::Library->dictionaries( <dictionary_id>,
    <dictionary_id>, ... )
        In list context, returns a list of Color::Library::Dictionary
        objects (for each <dictionary_id> passed in

        In scalar context, returns a hash of Color::Library::Dictionary
        objects mapping a dictionary id to a dictionary

        When called without arguments, the method will return all
        dictionaries

    $color = Color::Library->color( <query> )
        Returns a Color::Library::Color object found via <query>

        A query can be any of the following:

        color name
            A color name is like "blue" or "bleached-almond"

        color title
            A color title is like "Dark Green-Teal"

        color id
            A color id is in the form of <dictionary_id>:<color_name>, for
            example: "x11:azure1"

    color( <query>, <query>, ... )
        In list context, returns a list of Color::Library::Color objects
        corresponding to each <query>

        In scalar context, just returns the first <query>

    color( <dictionaries>, <query>, ... )
        If an array reference is passed as the first argument, then this
        indicates that the array is a list of dictionary ids to search
        through (in order):

            # Search in the svg and x11 dictionaries for a match
            my $blue = Color::Library->color([qw/svg x11/], "blue");
    
            # Will not find "aquamarine1" in the svg dictionary, so it will try the x11 dictionary
            my $aquamarine1 = Color::Library->color([qw/svg x11/], "aquamarine1");

    $color = Color::Library->colors
    $color = Color::Library->colour
    $color = Color::Library->colours
        All are aliases for the above color method

ABOUT
    This package was inspired by Graphics::ColorNames, and covers much of
    the same ground. However, I found the Graphics::ColorNames interface
    difficult to use. I also wanted to list colors directly in the perldoc,
    which this package does.
